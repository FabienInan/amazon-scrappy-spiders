{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "George R.R. Martin is simply unbelievable in his writing. As many have most likely already stated, he literally created a world. That world is not only made believable if it truly existed, but also every aspect and every corner of it lacks nothing: religions and constellations and games and cultures and traditions, languages and behaviours, foods and medicines..... the list goes on. Within all these aspects is a story that takes epic writing not only to a new level, but soars above the greatest writings of fantastic authors. Within his story are words that accentuate what he's saying, describing what's going on with shocking clarity (and often, in unorthodox ways that make you  smile unwittingly with understanding).I cannot praise these books enough. They take me away from things in many ways (including getting other things done). I am a published author and my second book has been delayed, I must admit, partially because I couldn't put his damn books down.\n            "},

I highly recommend you buy it now, as the price is good and that you read them before George R. R.

{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "This is the most awesome and detailed series I have ever seen.I now own the first three Seasons and I can hardly wait for Season 4 to come out on DVD.Since there only have been 10 Episodes in each Season, hopefully Season 4 will be available later this year!!I don't subscribe to HBO and I probably would not watch the weekly Episodes but wait anyway until I can purchase the whole Season. I have purchased the books, but I will wait reading them until the Series is completed. I did the same with \"Pillars of the Earth\" and \"World Without End\", also two great Mini-Series.\n            "},

{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "So well written!  Plot, character development and the ties that bind the world of King's Landing to the world of the mother of dragons are  unbelievably seductive....Having worked as an editor for years I have trouble shutting off the function in my brain and suspending....you know.  George R.R. Martin is a true wordsmith.  May he bless us with many more stories.  Blessings.\n            "},

Watching the series is even better on the second watch, after reading the books. They're well written, and there are more cliffhangers than the show can offer simply due to the elegance of the writing.\n            "}
